# HSTU-STUDENTS-FINANCIAL-AID
This financial support system is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and 
optimize the process of managing donations for organizations and non-profit entities. 
This serves as a centralized platform that facilitates the entire lifecycle of donations, from initial donor engagement to fund allocation and reporting. It leverages modern technology to address challenges commonly faced by organizations in effectively managing and
utilizing the contributions they receive.

## Problem Description
In the realm of nonprofit organizations and charitable endeavors, the effective management 
of donations plays a pivotal role in achieving mission objectives and creating positive
social impact. However, the traditional methods of donation management have often been
plagued by inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and challenges in donor engagement. These
shortcomings have prompted the need for a modern and comprehensive solution.
Nowadays we can get help from far distance in a short time. And most of the time there is
a major thing is security and every system must have a security system.

## Problem statement
In today's digital age, where online transactions and electronic payments have become
commonplace, nonprofit organizations face a significant challenge when it comes to
collecting donations offline. While online charity platforms offer convenience and
accessibility, there are several critical issues associated with offline donation collection
that hinder the efficiency and transparency of the process. Even people nowadays are so
busy that they will not get the time to come to the university to give donations.
## Project Description
This project is aimed at developing an online platform for fundraising and it is the easiest
way because here a donor can donate his money easily. He doesn’t have to come to that exact
place to donate the money. Here we have a home section, an About section, Programs,
Education section, Registration section, log-in section, and join section.The donor can see
the amount of money have received and the amount of money needed. Here one can give
money and take money also. Here we will have a log-in section and there will be two log-in sections user log-in and authority log-in. Users can just see the data but can’t edit it but
authority can edit also.
## Project Useful to Society
This application is very useful for collecting money for poor students or suppose a
student has a major illness and their parents have no financial support for their child in
this case our system can help a lot. It can take money and also donate money. So our
application provides them a single platform for all the details collecting money and
helping the students. More usefulness like someone wants to donate but doesn’t
have much time in this case we can use this online platform.

## Technologies Requirements

## Background theory
1. Here on the first page will be the home page to introduce our project motive.
2. Next will be the gallery section here we can see all the images of helping
students.
3. In the About Us section here people can get the donations they need and
give them donations for poor students.
4. There will be a login section for new members to log in and sign up for
options for those who don’t have an account.
5. If a user doesn’t have an account he can sign up and for a user there is no
need to have permission it will log in automatically.
6. If an authority doesn’t have an account he can sign up and the previously
permitted author can permit login.
7. Lastly there will be a contact section where anyone can contact through
email and phone number.

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
1. We will do more details work on the Home page, photos page, about page, and Donation

2. We will add a gateway system for online payment.
3. We are not working session time of a single account. We will work on this future.
4. There is an option to insert an attachment for a confirming donation to the user who wants
a donation

## CONCLUSION
In our proposed system we have built a system where we can help every students of HSTU.
Here we have kept the option for the user and authority and the user can log in and ask for a donation
or if he wants he can donate. On the other hand, authority can edit the function who
need donation or not and from that students will get help and we keep our system
so easy to use and maintain security
